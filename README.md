# The Github Repository has now been created. So far, we further refined the data for our project, which will be important for our future tasks. The process of writing the research paper has been started. The contributions to the research paper are being made, and so this will be updated frequently as we move further along in the project. The creation of the Github page will allow our team to update everyone on the progress being made.

# Work on the research paper is ongoing. The data for the project is still being refined. AUC (area_under_curve) has now been added to the results, therefore these results will be added to the paper as another important contribution.
